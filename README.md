I made a mess of this assignment, but I know something needs to be handed in so here it is. I started the HTML/CSS early in the week with the intention to tweak it along the way, which I never got around to because the JavaScript bogged me down so much. Basically nothing works. I feel some of what I have here is close, but nothing is firing at all. I really am sorry for this one. 

I decided to purchase an a supplemental online course for JavaScript to help me navigate it outside the classroom more. I'm working on that the rest of the weekend. 

Again, very sorry for this mess of an assignment. If you could look at my JavaScript and let me know how far off I am (or tweaks that would have made it close, I'd be very grateful)
